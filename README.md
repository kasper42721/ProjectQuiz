# This page is meant to provide some important information, tasks and responsibilities

# Project Members: 
1) Kashish Goel
2) Tanmay Thareja

# Desciption:
In simple words, its a canvas alternative designed by MUJ Students for MUJ Students. 
(Can be expanded later include other universities too)
The main purpose of the hack would be to enable faculty to design fast, reliable and excellent quality quizzes which can be taken by students at fixed times. It keeps tracks of their results and also give alerts.

# Why an alternative to Canvas? What's wrong with Canvas?
Canvas is not good enough. Crashes and lags are almost emminent when there is large traffic on the server. aka Server wasn't made scalable by Canvas Developers. So Instead our app will use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) which is an auto-scalabe server provided by Google. It is heavy-traffic ready and super fast.
Also, a university using a third-party software to conduct internal quizzes doesn't look good. Instead, a university using an app designed by its students to conduct internal exams would be proud to showcase this. This will also reflect the skill level of the students and increase placement opportunities.

# Tasks Assigned to Kashish: 
Handle app development for both Android and IOS Devices using one codebase i.e. Flutter, Handle backend Database management for both Web and App Data with most probably FireBase , Manage web-hosting on Google Cloud Platform, Manage Authentication for Web App in Firebase, Manage the same authentication information for authentication into the app
